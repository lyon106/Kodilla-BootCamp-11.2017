Theory: *Primitives as values and way of managing it in memory (string, number, boolean, null, undefined), literals as a way of declaring variable which contain primitive - it is some kinf of representation and initilizer, presented as list with its own syntax/special charts; another way of declaration: constructors (with key-word "new" for creating new instance and 'this' as context) - special functions; prototypes (as a way to avoid excessive amount of methods when creating much instances)*  
Practice: **Creating 'class' Phone and few instances of it**

Theory: *AJAX as a technology, basing on XMLHttpRequest. Benefits of using AJAX: possibility to create apps, which are reloading only these parts that we want to, instead of reloading full site*  
3. **Distinction between synchronous and asynchronous in JavaScript**  
Theory: *Synchronous: the program is executed linearly, functions are performed after performing the previous ones, as they appear in code; asynchronous: using event loop, what results possibility to moving execution of functions over time*
